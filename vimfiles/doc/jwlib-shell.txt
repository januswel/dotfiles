"shell", specifically following files.

autoload/shell.vim
	Contains functions to get informations about shell.

PROVIDES						*jwlib-shell-provides*

Functions:
shell#GetType()
		Return a String to show type of the 'shell'.  All of returned
		values are listed below.

		value	meaning ~
		cmd	command prompt in win32
		csh	C shell or tcsh
		zsh	Z shell
		sh	Bourne Shell or Bourne-Again Shell

shell#GetEncoding([{expr}])
		Return a String to show encoding used by the 'shell'.
		When there is {expr} and its evaluated value is true, this
		function may use a risky method to get more exact value.  In
		particular, changing 'encoding' may happen internally, and
		this processing may have side effects.

		Note that this function falls a long way short of perfection.
		Don't trust too much.
